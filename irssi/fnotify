emassey this looks legit
emassey the acra should should be "uncovered"
emassey but that is something i let sit in there on purpose so you'd have files to play with
emassey if you ran kamaji locally it would wash away
emassey i can be if you want it to be
emassey actually
emassey yes
emassey i can set that up if you want
emassey I noticed but agree its not a big deal
emassey how could it be improved
emassey i also don't think there will be that many verifications
emassey <famous last words>
emassey i'm actually spending a lot of time trying to make kamaji's validation more performant
emassey i think it's not going to scale in its current form
emassey but have a pretty well thought out plan to take care of it
emassey i'm going to spend this weekend trying it out
emassey ok
emassey no
emassey the validation hasn't been run on this one yet
emassey b/c 500 verifications takes minutes to run
emassey which is why i'm working on improving the code
emassey i killed the worker prematurely so the data never got updated for some of them
emassey lets hope static fire goes better than that
emassey the cool thing about rockets...success or failure...still impressive as fuck to watch
emassey f9r dev2 is about to ship to texas anyway
emassey no
emassey will do it now
emassey deploying now
emassey got distracted
emassey some kid posted all the f9r stuff on twitter
emassey my roomate is in prop and was super curious
emassey bamboo has built it so it should take a second to get up and running and pointing to jira

emassey "he's probably packing right now" -cbanek
